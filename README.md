# Raid-Simulator (Work in progress)
Raid Simulator is a simulator predicting a Survival, "Dps" and "Hps" using a data from warcraftlogs.com written in Unity, project used to self-learning. Finished project is buildt in WebGL version. This is my very first project, code is tightly nested and needs a lot of refactorization. I wrote it when i had no idea how to properly manage code and transfer data properly between functions.

THIS IS NOT FINISHED VERSION OF A PROJECT, A LOT OF FEATURES ARE MISSING.
